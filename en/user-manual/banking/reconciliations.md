Reconciliations
===============

Bank reconciliation is a process performed to ensure that your company's income and expense records are correct and that the bank's records are also correct.

Reconciled income/expense transactions get protected so they can't be deleted.

Reconciliations page is located under **Banking > Reconciliations** menu. On this page you can see all reconciliations, search for any, create a new one, edit the current ones and delete them.

- **Created Date**: The date reconciliation is performed.

- **Period**: The start and end date of the reconciliation.
- **Closing Balance**: The reconciled balance.
