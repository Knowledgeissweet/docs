Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation of Akaunting, the [free accounting software](https://akaunting.com).

This guide serves as a resource to users and developers needing direction in the Akaunting interface or code. Everyone is welcome to help make this information better and improve as needed.

### Users

You may start with the [dashboard](https://akaunting.com/docs/user-manual/dashboard) page and the [toolbar](https://akaunting.com/docs/user-manual/toolbar) description. Then see how [companies](https://akaunting.com/docs/user-manual/companies) work and check [users](https://akaunting.com/docs/user-manual/auth/users) page for permissions. Confused about the difference between invoices and revenues? [Check](https://akaunting.com/docs/faq/invoices-vs-revenues) it out. Here you can [learn](https://akaunting.com/docs/faq/bills-vs-payments) what is a payment and a bill.

### Developers

Akaunting is built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework, make sure you've got how it works first. The [modules](https://akaunting.com/docs/developer-manual/modules) article is the essential of developing apps. Then you can check how to show your app in navigation [menu](https://akaunting.com/docs/developer-manual/menu). Akaunting ships with fine-grained [permissions](https://akaunting.com/docs/developer-manual/permissions) and it's crucial to implement them into your app. [RESTful API](https://akaunting.com/docs/developer-manual/restful-api) is one of the most important parts of Akaunting.
